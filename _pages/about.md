Welcome!

I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan. My research agenda focuses on topics at the intersection of development, health, and political economics.

Prior to the PhD, I served as a predoctoral research fellow at the [Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research][Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research] (SIEPR) with Professor [Matthew Gentzkow][Matthew Gentzkow]. Before this, I served as a research assistant at the [Brown University School of Public Health Incubator Lab][Brown University School of Public Health Incubator Lab] with Dean [Ashish Jha][Ashish Jha]. I earned my BA at the University of Southern California, where I studied Economics and Political Science. 

As an aspiring academic, I hope to leverage the intersection of development economics, public policy, and social enterprise for positive social outcomes. I am particularly invested in uncovering the social roots of health inequalities, and identifying the effects of these inequities on marginalized communities in the U.S. and abroad.
