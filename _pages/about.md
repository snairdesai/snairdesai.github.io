I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Michigan and a Graduate Fellow in the Demography Training Program at the [Population Studies Center][Population Studies Center]. My research agenda focuses on topics at the intersection of health, development, and digital economics.

I previously served as a predoctoral research fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) with Professor [Matthew Gentzkow][Matthew Gentzkow], and as a full-time research assistant at the Brown University School of Public Health with Dean [Ashish Jha][Ashish Jha]. I earned my BA at the University of Southern California, where I studied Economics and Political Science.
