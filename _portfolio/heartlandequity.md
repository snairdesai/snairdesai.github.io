venue: 'USC Equity Research Institute'
abstract: "​This was one of the first projects I did as part of the research team at USC’s Equity Research Institute. We were interested in studying the entrepreneurial trends of minority businesses in the U.S. Midwest. To conduct this analysis, I meticulously scraped PolicyLink data from the National Equity Atlas, which captured demographic and entrepreneurial trends following the Great Recession. An excerpt of our work was later presented and published by the Kauffman Foundation."
