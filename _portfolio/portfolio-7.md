Despite complex care needs during critical COVID-19, the associated long-term healthcare spending is poorly understood, limiting the ability of policy-makers to prioritise necessary care and plan for future medical countermeasures. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults hospitalised with COVID-19 in the USA (April ‒ June 2020) using data from the national PINC AI Healthcare Database. Patients were followed for 365 days to measure hospital spending starting on the date of admission. We used a multivariable logistic model to identify characteristics associated with high spending. Among 73,606 patients hospitalised with COVID-19, 73% were aged ≥50 years, 51% were female, and 37% were non-Hispanic white. Mean hospital spending per patient over 90 days was US$28 712 (SD = $48,583) and over 365 days was US$31 768 (SD = $52,811). Patients who received care in the intensive care unit (36% vs 23% no intensive care, $p<$0.001), received a non-recommended COVID-19 treatment (28% vs 25% no treatment, $p<$0.001), had a longer length of stay ($p<$0.001), and had Medicare (27% vs 22% commercial, $p<$0.001) or Medicaid (25% vs 22% commercial, $p<$0.001) insurance were associated with a higher predicted probability of high hospital spending over 365 days. Patients who received recommended treatment (21% vs 25% no treatment, $p<$0.001) and were Hispanic and any race (24% vs 26% non-Hispanic white, $p<$0.001), non-Hispanic Asian (25% vs 26% non-Hispanic white, $p=$0.011), ‘other’ or unknown race and ethnicity (24% vs 26% non-Hispanic white, $p<$0.001), or female (25% vs 26% male, $p<$0.001) were associated with a lower predicted probability of high hospital spending. Most hospital spending incurred over 1 year was for care within 90 days of admission. Patients receiving complex care or non-recommended treatments were associated with higher spending, while those receiving recommended treatments were associated with lower spending. These findings can inform pandemic preparedness planning.
