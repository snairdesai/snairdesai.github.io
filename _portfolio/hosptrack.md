title: "Hospital Vaccine Mandate Tracker"
collection: portfolio

venue: 'Global Epidemics'
abstract: "Our hospital vaccine mandate tracker provided academics, policymakers, and the broader public with a comprehensive overview of which hospitals and health systems have mandated COVID-19 vaccinations for their clinical and non-clinical staff. In a pandemic which had already cost too many lives and created too many hardships, hospitals must uphold this standard and ensure that health systems are the safest spaces possible. Leading public health experts, clinicians, and organizations (including the American Hospital Association and American College of Emergency Physicians, and the American Association of Medical Colleges) all agree on the importance of vaccine mandates for hospital staff. We created this tracker to enable communities to input practices from their own local hospitals, and rally for systematic change in mandated vaccination policies."
