abstract: "Despite complex care needs during critical COVID-19, the associated long-term healthcare spending is poorly understood, limiting the ability of policy-makers to prioritise necessary care and plan for future medical countermeasures. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults hospitalised with COVID-19 in the USA (April ‒ June 2020) using data from the national PINC AI Healthcare Database. Patients were followed for 365 days to measure hospital spending starting on the date of admission. We used a multivariable logistic model to identify characteristics associated with high spending. Among 73,606 patients hospitalised with COVID-19, 73% were aged ≥50 years, 51% were female, and 37% were non-Hispanic white. Mean hospital spending per patient over 90 days was USD: 28,712 and over 365 days was USD: 31,768. Patients who received care in the intensive care unit, received a non-recommended COVID-19 treatment, had a longer length of stay, and had Medicare or Medicaid insurance were associated with a higher predicted probability of high hospital spending over 365 days. Patients who received recommended treatment and were Hispanic and any race, ‘other’ or unknown race and ethnicity, or female were associated with a lower predicted probability of high hospital spending. Most hospital spending incurred over 1 year was for care within 90 days of admission. Patients receiving complex care or non-recommended treatments were associated with higher spending, while those receiving recommended treatments were associated with lower spending. These findings can inform pandemic preparedness planning."
