abstract: "Few studies have explored the attitudes of unique diasporas in the Asian American community. We administered a survey of South Asian Indian American college students and their parents across the United States, through which we consider three questions. First, do the political and social preferences of Indian Americans vary by generation? Second, if intergenerational differences emerge, where are they pronounced? Third, in what ways do the beliefs of Indian Americans differ from other Americans? We leverage a parent-child matched-pairs sample to examine attitudes on issues both in the United States and India. We find that Indian Americans display stark generational differences across political, social, and policy preferences. We present evidence that the formation of these beliefs might be linked to information sourcing, political participation, and peer socialization. We also derive comparisons between our sample and comparable representative surveys. These results offer a novel contribution to the literature on intergenerational differences."
