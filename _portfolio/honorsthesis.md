abstract: "My yearlong Honors Thesis in International Relations & Economics was my first foray into formative independent research. It was also the single most valuable learning experience of my college career. From constructing a research puzzle, to scraping and cleaning data, to visualizing and analyzing, to writing and preparing for publication, the Honors Thesis was immersive in every step of the research process. Motivated by the works of Professors Karthik Muralidharan and Geeta Gandhi Kingdon in Indian education, I decided to explore secondary education in Kerala, India (my home state). I wanted to measure the progress of national programs funded by the Indian Government which emphasized a universal access to secondary education and had recently been implemented by state governments: the Right to Education Act and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.

Previous studies had found that these policies focused on input-based education (i.e. building more schools and classrooms, increasing funds for education) rather than the pedagogy and quality of instruction itself. As such, many considered these programs to be under-performers given the massive budget and campaigns during the initial rollouts. However, Kerala represented an interesting case study for me because it has traditionally outperformed other Indian states on metrics of development, especially in education. Perhaps India could learn from Kerala’s own rubric of education, and their integration of these national programs. With this puzzle in mind, I formulated three null hypotheses:

1. 𝑇ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑜 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝒂𝒄𝒄𝒆𝒔𝒔 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒔.

2. 𝑇ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑜 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝒊𝒏𝒑𝒖𝒕𝒔 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒔.

3. 𝑇ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑜 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑝 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝒔𝒄𝒉𝒐𝒐𝒍 𝒕𝒚𝒑𝒆 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒔.

These hypotheses covered the breadth of the literature in education economics, which focused on the interplay of these features in determining learning outcomes. Furthermore, I decided to focus on the access and performance of historically marginalized groups in Kerala (and nationally). In order to perform the analysis, I merged data from Kerala’s state standardized test scores for secondary education (similar to our ACT), with national and state-level data on school inputs and infrastructure. I ran three preliminary estimation models: 1. a simple OLS regression with district controls, interaction terms, and clustered standard errors; 2. a fixed effects regression, which control for a school’s location within one of Kerala’s unique fourteen districts; 3. a principal component analysis model to collapse a larger range of district-level covariates and correct for minor collinearity in the fixed effects model.

The analysis suggests a negative relationship between disadvantaged enrollment and performance for minority castes and religions, a positive relationship between private education and learning outcomes, and no clear relationship between inputs and learning outcomes. Access appears to have increased for certain disadvantaged groups, across all school types. On the other hand, across all specifications, schools with higher enrollments of Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) students perform worse than those with students from the General Caste. Thus, even in the best case of education, the most disadvantaged groups perform poorly relative to their peers. However, there are clearly heterogenous effects."
