This op ed built on prior work in healthcare decentralization, with an application to vaccine diplomacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. We argued that many HMICs and “vaccine diplomats” were taking a short-sighted approach to global diplomacy and health capacity building. Participation in this vaccine diplomacy model, whereby powerful nations stockpile doses during crises and engage in selective distribution in exchange for political favor, is both inequitable and inefficient. Instead, HMICs and LMICs alike should lean on established multilateral frameworks for vaccine distribution, such as GAVI and COVAX. These IGOs are capable in managing crisis response, but are also adept in building long-term capacity building and promoting pandemic resilience. Importantly, investing in this infrastructure is beneficial for both LMICs and HMICs.
